# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Description of Project and Functionality

This propject serves as the back-end for the WTWR weather application that is responsible for handling requests from the WTWR application. It will take user input and send the corresponding requests to the server and the server will then do the necessary steps to add/delete/like/unlike an item.

## Description of Teechnology and techniques used

This project was made using the Express.js and Node.js frameworks to build a basic server to handle requests for the WTWR app.

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
